            I am passionate about building things digitally that interact and compliment
            the world physically. I started my journey in the tech industry in
            early 2013 with an IOS app named Money Shot. Money Shot started as
            an idea drawn on a napkin, bootstrapped and personally designed, and
            brought to life, finding its way to both the IOS and Android stores.
            I had zero experience in tech and worked with a development firm to
            create my idea. My passion project eventually ran out of momentum
            due to a lack of resources. I left feeling frustrated and
            unsatisfied that development stopped due to finances. The pain and
            frustration of failing lit a fire inside of me to learn how to
            create and develop on my own.

            Over the years, Iâ€™ve cultivated my passion for coding through books,
            Udemy courses, and free coding resources found on youtube. Looking
            to take my hobby seriously I joined and completed the Springboard
            software engineering Bootcamp, which I specifically chose due to its
            heavy focus on building a foundation with both the Javascript and
            Python languages.
